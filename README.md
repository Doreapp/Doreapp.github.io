# My resume/portfolio data holder

This repository is meant to store the data for my resume and portfolio.

It is also built to deploy a static website using `GitHub pages` and `Jekyll` offering a pretty representation of this data (see [jekyll subfolder](jekyll/README.md)).

## The data file: [`me.yml`](me.yml)

This file contains the description of my profile, for reuse in a portfolio or resume.

It shall respect a precise format. An example can be seen in [`me.yml` file](me.yml).

## Automatic format check

If you want to check the format of your `me.yml` file, you can use `pyfolio` python library in [`tools` directory](tools/).

## Translation

It is possible to translate the website manually. In this repository, you can see an example of portfolio
originally in english that has a translation in french.

To translate in a language, one needs to:
1. Translate the data by creating a `data.<language>.yml` file aside to `data.yml` (e.g. `data.en.yml`)
2. Create an override of the `jekyll` directory, named `jekyll-<language>` (e.g. `jekyll-en`)
3. Override the configuration of the website in this folder: copy-paste the `_config.yml` file from `jekyll` folder into `jekyll-<language>` and override the fields you want to.
4. Add `baseurl: /<language>` to the overriding configuration
5. Update the `github-pages.yml` workflow to generate the translated wesite along with the original one. Look at this repository `github-pages.yml` workflow for an example.
6. You're done! Go to `https://<username>.github.io/<language>` and you should see the translated website! ðŸŽ‰
