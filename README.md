# My resume/portfolio data holder

This repository is meant to store the data for my resume and portfolio.

It is also built to deploy a static website using `GitHub pages` and `Jekyll` offering a pretty representation of this data (see [jekyll subfolder](jekyll/README.md)).

## The data file: [`me.yml`](me.yml)

This file contains the description of my profile, for reuse in a portfolio or resume.

It shall respect a precise format.
