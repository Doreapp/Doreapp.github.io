    I worked on a project for Sirehna, a company that runs computational fluid
    dynamics (CFD) simulations to evaluate ship performances (amongst other things).
    My role in this project was to create a simulation and data management environment
    that would help the Sirehna team track and retrieve their data, as well as automate
    low-added-value tasks.

    I used the Girder library to instantiate a web server dedicated to managing users,
    their authentication and permissions. I also set up a MinIO instance to handle the
    large amount of data required for the CFD simulations and connected it to the web
    server. To further improve efficiency, I automated a simulation process by
    utilizing Gitlab pipelines features and custom Python scripts to facilitate
    communication between the server and the computation pipeline.

    The final piece of the puzzle was creating a user-friendly web interface using Girder
    web components, allowing users to easily start automated computations, monitor
    their progress, and keep track of their results.

    At Kissfly, I was in charge of improving the live video streaming system that

    The system was built with a Node.js Express server running on the drone and a
    headless Chromium instance running as a server's client, offering a connection in
    peer-to-peer to the ground station in order to stream the live video via
    WebRTC (RTC for Real Time Communication).

    My mission was to test multiple configurations in different environments
    in order to improve the maximum streaming distance, as well as the video latency and
    framerate. After several tests, I managed to improve these parameters, but I also
    concluded that these technologies were not well-suited for this specific use case
    and that they had reached their limits.

    This experience allowed me to work with new technologies and to understand their

    relatively to its start position, computed via SLAM algorithm (which was out of my
    mission scope). It also displayed the temporary trajectory
    and the drone's actual angles (pitch, roll and yaw). This representation was done
    using the Three.js library.
    - I added control buttons to the UI, which improved the user's ability to control the
    drone and made the interface more intuitive.

    This experience allowed me to work with new technologies and to understand how to
    improve the user experience. I was able to improve my skills in front-end
    development, user interface design, and problem-solving.

  description: >-
    As a school project, I was part of a team tasked with coming up with an idea for a
    mobile application. We decided to create an application that regroups all the
    e-scooter brands in Stockholm.

    The idea was that the user would only need to have a single app to compare
    the location and prices of the e-scooters nearby and access it.

    First, we created a web app. Using React and Tailwind CSS libraries, we designed
    the front-end. I focused on using the Leaflet library to
    display the map, the user location, and e-scooter pins on their locations, while
    other members of the team built other parts of the app, such as the
    communication with e-scooter brands' API.
    In the end, we ended up with a standalone web app that displayed e-scooters'
    location, but without the functionalities of rental.

    Secondly, we had to create a "native app". We chose to use React Native to be
    cross-platform. Once again, I was in charge of taking care of the map
    utilities, but this time, we didn't find easy-to-use and cross-platform libraries
    to display a map like Leaflet does. Thus, I implemented the Map tiles workflow,
    using Open Street Map data, in order to reproduce the behavior of a map component.
    It worked well, except for zooming utilities.
    We reached almost the same point with the native app as with the web app.

    This experience allowed me to work as part of a team and to develop my skills in web
    frontend and cross-platform development. I also gained experience in using React
    and React Native, as well as in using libraries like Leaflet and Open Street Map
    for maps. It also helped me to understand the challenges and differences in
    developing a web app and a native app.

    As a personal project, I aimed to create a backend with a relational database to
    store and serve my experiences and skills.
    The goal was to use this backend in a portfolio website, both displaying my
    skills to anybody and allowing myself to edit the data.

    From a full-stack template using FastAPI, Postgres, and Vue.js, I developed a
    full-stack website. The backend is based on FastAPI, which serves a REST API on top
    of a WSGI Http server (for which I used Gunicorn). Using the SQLAlchemy library,
    I designed the data model, both for user authentication and authorization
    workflows and to store professional skills. Good practices of using
    linters/formaters (Black, Pylint and Isort here), continuous integration (with
    GitHub Actions) and containerization (with Docker) were used here.

    The front-end is based on React, MUI and Tailwind CSS libraries (in opposition to
    Vue.js that was used in the original template). It uses Axios to communicate
    with the backend, including for authentication. Here too, good practices
    of using linters/formaters (Prettier, ESLint), continuous integration and
    containerization were applied.

    I also set up a reverse proxy, based on Traefik, in charge of redirecting API
    calls properly to the backend. It also uses Let's Encrypt to automatically renew
    a SSL certificate (needed to enable HTTPS protocol).

    The environment is described using Docker Compose, that includes the backend, the
    front-end, the reverse proxy, and other services like the Postgres database.

    During this project, which was ultimately abandoned, I learned how to build a
    real-world full-stack website, from the technical functionalities (e.g.
    authentication) to the deployment (GitHub Actions, AWS, domain name, SSL
    certificates...).
    I also learned how to set up a reverse proxy and how to work with various
    libraries and technologies like FastAPI, React, and SQLAlchemy.

    This project aimed to find the cheapest and most efficient way to Stockholm airport from the city, without paying the fee for the direct subway.
    Using the API provided by the Stockholm Transport company, I created a set of Python scripts to gather information on transportation options.
    The result was a set of scripts that could help travelers save money and find the best route to the airport.

    As part of a two-week school project for the ANTS (Advanced Neuro-rehabilitation Therapies & Sport) Association, I was part of a team of 7 engineer students tasked with creating virtual reality workshops to make gym and mobilization exercises more fun for disabled individuals.
    The final product was a game running on Oculus Quest, developed using Unity.
    The player takes flight in a real city and must complete repetitive exercises to move through gates and collect points in the sky.

    I developed an Android application that enables users to analyze their personal data from various apps such as Spotify and Facebook Messenger.
    The app required users to download their personal data from these apps and then analyzed it to display statistics such as their favorite artists and the amount of time spent listening to them.
    Although the app was never published, the source code is available on GitHub for anyone interested in learning more about its development and functionality.
    This project allowed me to gain experience in working with personal data, Android development, and data analysis.
