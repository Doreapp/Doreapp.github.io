    As a software engineer at Sirehna, I was tasked with the responsibility of
    developing a mass estimating software that met the specific needs of our clients.
    Using Python programming language, I worked on the core of the app, creating
    a database-centered API that was independent of the graphical user
    interface.
    <br><br>
    My focus was on implementing robust file reading and writing operations, and
    handling incorrect or missing data. This included using <code>pandas</code> library to read excel files
    and manage dataframes.
    <br>
    I used a relational database to ensure the integrity of the data, while also offering efficient computations.
    It implied working with <code>SQL</code> to query and update the software storage.
    <br>
    Additionally, I implemented features that properly managed the data history,
    using <code>Git</code> as the versioning tool.
    <br><br>
    To ensure the quality of the code, I followed several good practices,
    including the use of code formatters and linters (<code>black</code>, <code>pylint</code>, <code>isort</code>...),
    conteneurization with <code>Docker</code>,
    and continuous integration with Gitlab CI and code review.
    <br><br>
    Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with the clients to understand their needs and build a
    software that was truly useful to them.

    Phone History is an Android application retrieving the usage history of the phone.
    It gets the phone usage from Android system and displays it in a list
    starting with the most recent usage.
    It also explores the phone storage to display file modiciations, such as the pictures taken or
    the files downloaded.
    Finally, it display statistics about the phone usage during the last 24 hours. This includes
    the Top 10 user applications in terms of usage, and the associated duration as well as
    a chronological graph of the phone usage per hour.
    <br><br>
    Technically, the app uses <code>UsageEvents</code> API to recover the apps' usage.
    An algorithm is dedicated to read data from this API, which only returns <i>events</i>.
    <br>
    Android system only keeps record of the phone usage during few days, so the app is
    unable of showing any older app usage.
    Therefore, <code>PhoneHistory</code> stores the app usage in an internal <code>SQL</code> database.
    <br><br>
    This application is - when I am writing this - my most popular app on the Google Play Store.

    As a school project, I was part of a team tasked with coming up with an idea for a
    mobile application. We decided to create an app that regroups all the
    e-scooter brands in Stockholm.
    The idea was that the user would only need to have a single app to compare
    the locations and prices of e-scooters nearby, and access it.
    <br><br>
    First, we created a web app.
    Using <code>React JS</code> and <code>Tailwind CSS</code>, we designed
    the front-end. The app could be standalone, as the back-end part was the
    e-scooter brands' APIs.
    <br>
    I focused on using <code>Leaflet</code> library to display the map,
    the user location, and the e-scooter pins.
    The other members of the team built different parts of the app, such as the
    communication with e-scooter brands' API.
    <br>
    In the end, we ended up with a standalone web app that displayed e-scooters'
    locations, but without the ability to actually rent an e-scooter.
    <br><br>
    In the second part of the course, we had to create a <i>native app</i>.
    We chose to use <code>React Native</code> to be cross-platform and somehow close
    to what we had done during the first assignment.
    <br>
    Once again, I was in charge of taking care of the map utilities.
    However, I didn't find easy-to-use and cross-platform libraries for <code>React Native</code>
    to display a map like <code>Leaflet</code> does.
    Thus, I implemented the Map tiles workflow myself, using <code>Open Street Map</code> data,
    in order to reproduce the behavior of a map component.
    It ended up working properly, except for zooming utilities.
    <br>
    We reached almost the same point with the native app as with the web app.
    <br><br>
    This experience allowed me to work as part of a team, fully in english as we were from different countries
    in Europe, and to develop my skills in web frontend and cross-platform development.
    I also gained experience in using <code>React</code> and <code>React Native</code>,
    as well as in working with maps, using <code>Leaflet</code> and <code>Open Street Map</code> data.
    It also helped me to understand the challenges and differences in developing a web app and a native app.

    I worked on a project for SIREHNA, a company that runs computational fluid
    dynamics (CFD) simulations to evaluate ship performances (amongst other things).
    My role in this project was to create a simulation and data management environment
    that would help SIREHNA team track and retrieve their data, as well as automate
    low value-added tasks.
    <br><br>
    After working on understanding the users' needs, I worked with the team on defining the environment architecture.
    We chose to use a web server as the corner stone of the architecture.
    We highlighted the functional needs such as User authentication, User management and data storage,
    and then benchmarked technologies.
    <br><br>
    I used <code>Girder</code> library to instantiate a web server dedicated to managing users,
    their authentication and permissions. Using this library allowed us to gain time in implementing
    user authentication and management functionalities.
    <br><br>
    To answer the large data storage need - coming from geometries involved in the CFD simulations that
    can weight tens of GB - I set up a <code>MinIO</code> instance.
    As <code>MinIO</code> uses Amazon <i>Simple Storage Service</i> (<code>S3</code>) standards, I could
    easily connect it to the <code>Girder</code>-based web server.
    <br><br>
    Another main part of the environment, which was very time consuming, was to automated
    some of the CFD simulation processes.
    As a <code>GitLab</code> server was hosted internally, I used its pipelines features
    (which are mostly designed for <code>CI/CD</code> purpose) to fully automate simulations.
    The idea was to use <code>GitLab</code> pipeline's scheduler to separate the main steps of a simulation.
    The actual computation scripts were executed through <code>Makefile</code> scripts, while communications with the
    <code>Girder</code>-based web server were done via <code>Python</code> scripts.
    In order to execute computations efficiently, we installed a <code>GitLab Runner</code> on a device
    with a large computational power.
    <br><br>
    The final piece of the puzzle was creating a user-friendly web interface using <code>Girder</code>
    web components, allowing users to easily start automated computations, monitor
    their progress, and keep track of their results.

    TakeNews is a mobile-orientied website built with React, MUI components,
    and Tailwind CSS.
    The goal of this project was to create a web app that allows users to stay in touch
    with their contacts regularly.
    The app is designed specifically for mobiles as the  main objective was to explore
    the potential of a web application to take advantage of various mobile device
    features, similarly to native mobile apps.
    <br><br>
    First, the app uses <code>local storage</code> feature of browsers, which enable user-specific storage
    on the client side. As the goal was to create a standalone website (i.e. without a back-end),
    this kind of storage was answering every need. I also though of using <code>IndexedDB</code> API but
    as the data stored was small, I prefered to use <code>local storage</code>.
    <br><br>
    Then, as the app goal was to make the user keep contacts with friends and familly,
    the app is able of openning the phone
    dialer app. This is done simply by using <code>tel:</code> scheme.
    <br>
    In the future, I hope I'll be able of openning other external applications, such as <i>Facebook Messenger</i>.
    <br><br>
    Finally, using <code>Navigator.contacts</code> experimental API, the app is able (on <i>Chrome</i>) of
    browsing the phone's contact list and let the user pick one to import in the app.
    <br><br>
    The app development is still in progress, and soon enough I would like to enable notifications, that
    would remember the user to contact the persons he/she haven't be talking for a while.
    <br><br>
    Technically, <i>TakeNews</i> is hosted on <code>GitHub pages</code> as a standalone web app. It
    is build with <code>React JS</code> using <code>MUI</code> components and icons in addition to
    <code>Tailwind CSS</code> for some styling.
    <br>
    <code>ESLint</code> and <code>Prettier</code> are used locally and in <i>Continuous Integration</i> workflows
    to enforce code format. <code>Docker</code> is used to offer a portable container, usable regardless
    of the <i>Operating System</i>.

    Project of building my portfolio, using high-level technologies and centering the development
    on the data.
    The idea was to first write down my experiences, projects, profile, education, etc. and then
    build a portfolio website around this. It ended up in a single <code>yaml</code> file,
    a website and <code>python</code> scripts.
    <br><br>
    You are probably reading this on the website resulting of this project
    (<a href="https://antoine.mandin.dev"><code>https://antoine.mandin.dev</code></a>).
    <br><br>
    The first - and main - part of this project, is the actual data.
    I have condensed my experiences, projects and skills into a single <code>yaml</code> file.
    <br><br>
    The second part of the project is the portfolio website.
    It is built using <code>Jekyll</code>, and hosted on <code>GitHub pages</code>.
    I used a pre-existing theme (named <code>Beautiful Jekyll</code>) which I overrided with
    custom styles inspired from other <code>jekyll</code> themes.
    Using a plugin, I managed to create almost entirely the website from the <code>yaml</code> data
    file. I also implemented a search bar using <code>MiniSearch</code> library.
    <br>
    In the end, I built a static website, hosted on <code>GitHub pages</code>, with its own styling,
    search engine and domain name.
    <br><br>
    Finally, the third part of the project was a small <code>python</code> module dedicated to check the format of
    the data.
    I build a <i>grammar</i> file in <code>yaml</code>, representing the expected content of the data
    (e.g. that a project must a <code>title</code>, which is a text, and may have an
    <code>end-date</code> with the format <code>dd-mm-yyyy</code>) including the references workflow.
    Indeed, the whole idea was to have a consistent website, where projects may be linked to a job,
    and a job to a company, etc.
    <br>
    This <code>python</code> module was accompanied by formatters and linters, and used in a
    Continuous Integration workflow, to ensure that the data is well formatted all along its lifetime.
    <br><br>
    This project is still in progress when I wrote that.

    The goal was to use this backend in a portfolio website, both displaying my
    skills to anybody and allowing myself to edit the data.
    <br><br>
    From a full-stack template using <code>FastAPI</code>, <code>PostgreSQL</code>,
    and <code>Vue JS</code>, I developed a full-stack website.
    The back-end was based on <code>FastAPI</code>, which serves a <code>REST</code> API on top
    of a <code>WSGI HTTP</code> server (for which I used <code>Gunicorn</code>).
    Using <code>SQLAlchemy</code> library, I designed the data model, both for user
    authentication and authorization workflows and to store professional skills.
    Good practices of using linters/formaters (<code>black</code>, <code>pylint</code> and
    <code>isort</code> here), continuous integration (with <code>GitHub Actions</code>)
    and containerization (with <code>Docker</code>) were used.
    <br><br>
    The front-end is based on <code>React JS</code>, <code>MUI</code> and
    <code>Tailwind CSS</code> libraries (in opposition to <code>Vue JS</code> that was used
    in the original template). It uses <code>Axios</code> to communicate with the backend,
    including for authentication. Here again, good practices
    of using linters/formaters (<code>Prettier</code> and <code>ESLint</code>),
    continuous integration and containerization were applied.
    <br><br>
    I also set up a reverse proxy, based on <code>Traefik</code>, in charge of redirecting API
    calls properly to the back-end. It uses <code>Let's Encrypt</code> to automatically renew
    a <code>SSL</code> certificate (needed to enable <code>HTTPS</code> protocol).
    <br><br>
    The architecture is described using <code>Docker Compose</code>, that includes the back-end, the
    front-end, the reverse proxy, and other services like the <code>PostgreSQL</code> database.
    <br><br>
    The back-end was hosted on <i>Amazon Web Service</i> (<code>AWS</code>), using an
    <i>Elastic Compute Cloud</i> (<code>EC2</code>) instance.
    A custom domain name (<code>mandin.dev</code>) was dedicated to this website.
    Finally, Continuous Deployment workflows were setup to deploy automatically
    the website updates in production.
    <br><br>
    During this project, which was ultimately abandoned, I learned how to build a
    real-world full-stack website, from the technical functionalities (e.g.
    authentication) to the deployment (<code>GitHub Actions</code>, <code>AWS</code>,
    domain name, <code>SSL</code> certificates, etc.).
    I also learned how to set up a reverse proxy and how to work with various
    libraries and technologies like <code>FastAPI</code>, <code>React</code>, and
    <code>SQLAlchemy</code>.

    As a personal project, I developed a python library resulting in a Sphinx
    extension to enable Mermaid graphs in generated documentation. This library
    allow to create interactive and visually appealing graphs within Sphinx
    documentation, making it more informative and user-friendly.
    <br><br>
    I learned how to create a <code>Sphinx</code> extension and how to deploy a <code>Python</code>
    package to <code>PyPI</code> (Python Package Index).
    <br><br>
    Personally, I use a lot <code>mermaid</code> graphs, which are really easy to use
    and allow to create nice looking graphs with a ridiculously small boilerplate.
    Therefore, I wanted a <code>Sphinx</code> extension with an open license (here MIT),
    that would allow the use of such graphs in generated documents.
    <br><br>
    This project is Open Source on <code>GitHub</code> and I even had my very first contributor
    in this project, which submitted is own issue and pull request, that was finally merge.
    <br><br>
    During the development of this extension, a set of best practices was put in place.
    First, linters and formatters were used (<code>black</code>, <code>pylint</code> and <code>isort</code>),
    to ensure the format of the code. Secondly, continuous integration, via <code>GitHub actions</code>,
    was implemented. It was in charge of making sure the format rules were respected.
    Finally, continuous deployment was also in place in the form of <code>GitHub actions</code>,
    pushing the package to <code>PyPI</code> when a <code>GitHub</code> release was created.
    <br><br>
    This experience allowed me to improve my skills in <code>Python</code> development and package
    management, as well as my understanding of the <code>Sphinx</code> documentation system.

  description: >-
    At Kissfly, I was in charge of improving the live video streaming system that
    broadcasted the video taken on the drone to the ground station.
    The system was built with a Node.js Express server running on the drone and a
    headless Chromium instance running as a server's client, offering a connection in
    peer-to-peer to the ground station in order to stream the live video via
    WebRTC (RTC for Real Time Communication).

    My mission was to test multiple configurations in different environments
    in order to improve the maximum streaming distance, as well as the video latency and
    framerate. After several tests, I managed to improve these parameters, but I also
    concluded that these technologies were not well-suited for this specific use case
    and that they had reached their limits.

    This experience allowed me to work with new technologies and to understand their
    limitations and capabilities. I was able to improve my skills in live video
    streaming, web development, and problem-solving.

    At Kissfly, I was an assigned to improve the ground station user interface.
    To accomplish this, I implemented several features:
    - I added a 3D representation of the drone state, which displays the drone position
    relatively to its start position, computed via SLAM algorithm (which was out of my
    mission scope). It also displayed the temporary trajectory
    and the drone's actual angles (pitch, roll and yaw). This representation was done
    using the Three.js library.
    - I added control buttons to the UI, which improved the user's ability to control the
    drone and made the interface more intuitive.

    This experience allowed me to work with new technologies and to understand how to
    improve the user experience. I was able to improve my skills in front-end
    development, user interface design, and problem-solving.

    I developed an Android application that enables users to analyze their personal data from various apps such as Spotify and Facebook Messenger.
    The app required users to download their personal data from these apps and then analyzed it to display statistics such as their favorite artists and the amount of time spent listening to them.
    Although the app was never published, the source code is available on GitHub for anyone interested in learning more about its development and functionality.
    This project allowed me to gain experience in working with personal data, Android development, and data analysis.
