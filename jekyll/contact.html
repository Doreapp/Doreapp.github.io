  Hey there! I'm glad you stumbled upon my corner of the internet.
  If you're here, I'm guessing you want to get in touch with me.
        Well, you're in luck! Whether you have a job offer, a project in mind, or just want to say hi, I'm all ears!</p>

{% if site.data.me.profile[0].email and site.data.me.profile[0].linkedin %}
  <p>
    If you prefer to reach me through email, you can send me a message at
    <a href="mailto:{{ site.data.me.profile[0].email }}">{{ site.data.me.profile[0].email }}</a>.
    I promise to respond as soon as possible (unless I'm taking a nap or eating a giant burrito, in which case it may
                take a bit longer).</p>

  <p>
    If you're more of a LinkedIn person, you can find me there too.
    Just follow
    <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/{{ site.data.me.profile[0].linkedin }}">this link</a>.
  </p>

{% else %}
  <p>
    Unfortunatelly, I do not provide direct contact mediums on this page, you'll have to dig in the internet...
  </p>
{% endif %}

  Thanks for stopping by! I look forward to hearing from you soon.
