Using the Python programming language, I worked on the core of the app, creating a database-centered API that was independent of the graphical user interface.My focus was on implementing robust file reading and writing operations, and handling incorrect or missing data. I utilized a relational database to ensure the integrity of the data, while also offering efficient computations. Additionally, I implemented features that properly managed the data history, using Git as the versioning tool.To ensure the quality of the code, I followed several good practices, including the use of code formatters and linters, conteneurization with Docker, and continuous integration with Gitlab CI and code review. Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with the clients to understand their needs and build a software that was truly useful to them.The project is still ongoing while I am writing this.",

My role in this project was to create a simulation and data management environment that would help the Sirehna team track and retrieve their data, as well as automate low-added-value tasks.I used the Girder library to instantiate a web server dedicated to managing users, their authentication and permissions. I also set up a MinIO instance to handle the large amount of data required for the CFD simulations and connected it to the web server. To further improve efficiency, I automated a simulation process by utilizing Gitlab pipelines features and custom Python scripts to facilitate communication between the server and the computation pipeline.The final piece of the puzzle was creating a user-friendly web interface using Girder web components, allowing users to easily start automated computations, monitor their progress, and keep track of their results.",

The system was built with a Node.js Express server running on the drone and a headless Chromium instance running as a server's client, offering a connection in peer-to-peer to the ground station in order to stream the live video via WebRTC (RTC for Real Time Communication).My mission was to test multiple configurations in different environments in order to improve the maximum streaming distance, as well as the video latency and framerate. After several tests, I managed to improve these parameters, but I also concluded that these technologies were not well-suited for this specific use case and that they had reached their limits.This experience allowed me to work with new technologies and to understand their limitations and capabilities. I was able to improve my skills in live video streaming, web development, and problem-solving.",

It also displayed the temporary trajectory and the drone's actual angles (pitch, roll and yaw). This representation was done using the Three.js library. - I added control buttons to the UI, which improved the user's ability to control the drone and made the interface more intuitive.This experience allowed me to work with new technologies and to understand how to improve the user experience.

        "description": "As a school project, I was part of a team tasked with coming up with an idea for a mobile application. We decided to create an application that regroups all the e-scooter brands in Stockholm.The idea was that the user would only need to have a single app to compare the location and prices of the e-scooters nearby and access it.First, we created a web app. Using React and Tailwind CSS libraries, we designed the front-end. I focused on using the Leaflet library to display the map, the user location, and e-scooter pins on their locations, while other members of the team built other parts of the app, such as the communication with e-scooter brands' API. In the end, we ended up with a standalone web app that displayed e-scooters' location, but without the functionalities of rental.Secondly, we had to create a &quot;native app&quot;. We chose to use React Native to be cross-platform. Once again, I was in charge of taking care of the map utilities, but this time, we didn't find easy-to-use and cross-platform libraries to display a map like Leaflet does. Thus, I implemented the Map tiles workflow, using Open Street Map data, in order to reproduce the behavior of a map component. It worked well, except for zooming utilities. We reached almost the same point with the native app as with the web app.This experience allowed me to work as part of a team and to develop my skills in web frontend and cross-platform development. I also gained experience in using React and React Native, as well as in using libraries like Leaflet and Open Street Map for maps. It also helped me to understand the challenges and differences in developing a web app and a native app.",

        "description": "As a personal project, I aimed to create a backend with a relational database to store and serve my experiences and skills. The goal was to use this backend in a portfolio website, both displaying my skills to anybody and allowing myself to edit the data.From a full-stack template using FastAPI, Postgres, and Vue.js, I developed a full-stack website. The backend is based on FastAPI, which serves a REST API on top of a WSGI Http server (for which I used Gunicorn). Using the SQLAlchemy library, I designed the data model, both for user authentication and authorization workflows and to store professional skills. Good practices of using linters/formaters (Black, Pylint and Isort here), continuous integration (with GitHub Actions) and containerization (with Docker) were used here.The front-end is based on React, MUI and Tailwind CSS libraries (in opposition to Vue.js that was used in the original template). It uses Axios to communicate with the backend, including for authentication. Here too, good practices of using linters/formaters (Prettier, ESLint), continuous integration and containerization were applied.I also set up a reverse proxy, based on Traefik, in charge of redirecting API calls properly to the backend. It also uses Let's Encrypt to automatically renew a SSL certificate (needed to enable HTTPS protocol).The environment is described using Docker Compose, that includes the backend, the front-end, the reverse proxy, and other services like the Postgres database.During this project, which was ultimately abandoned, I learned how to build a real-world full-stack website, from the technical functionalities (e.g. authentication) to the deployment (GitHub Actions, AWS, domain name, SSL certificates...). I also learned how to set up a reverse proxy and how to work with various libraries and technologies like FastAPI, React, and SQLAlchemy.",
