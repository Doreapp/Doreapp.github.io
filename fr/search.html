Using &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt; programming language, I worked on the core of the app, creating a database-centered API that was independent of the graphical user interface. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; My focus was on implementing robust file reading and writing operations, and handling incorrect or missing data. This included using &lt;code&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt; library to read excel files and manage &lt;code&gt;dataframes&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;br&gt; I used a relational database to ensure the integrity of the data, while also offering efficient computations. It implied working with &lt;code&gt;SQL&lt;/code&gt; to query and update the software storage. &lt;br&gt; Additionally, I implemented features that properly managed the data history, using &lt;code&gt;Git&lt;/code&gt; as the versioning tool. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; To ensure the quality of the code, I followed several good practices, including the use of code formatters and linters (&lt;code&gt;black&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pylint&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;isort&lt;/code&gt;...), conteneurization with &lt;code&gt;Docker&lt;/code&gt;, and continuous integration with Gitlab CI and code review. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with the clients to understand their needs and build a software that was truly useful to them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;The project is still ongoing while I am writing this.&lt;/i&gt;",

This includes the Top 10 user applications in terms of usage, and the associated duration as well as a chronological graph of the phone usage per hour. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Technically, the app uses &lt;code&gt;UsageEvents&lt;/code&gt; API to recover the apps' usage. An algorithm is dedicated to read data from this API, which only returns &lt;i&gt;events&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br&gt; Android system only keeps record of the phone usage during few days, so the app is unable of showing any older app usage.

        "description": "As a school project, I was part of a team tasked with coming up with an idea for a mobile application. We decided to create an app that regroups all the e-scooter brands in Stockholm. The idea was that the user would only need to have a single app to compare the locations and prices of e-scooters nearby, and access it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; First, we created a web app. Using &lt;code&gt;React JS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Tailwind CSS&lt;/code&gt;, we designed the front-end. The app could be standalone, as the back-end part was the e-scooter brands' APIs. &lt;br&gt; I focused on using &lt;code&gt;Leaflet&lt;/code&gt; library to display the map, the user location, and the e-scooter pins. The other members of the team built different parts of the app, such as the communication with e-scooter brands' API. &lt;br&gt; In the end, we ended up with a standalone web app that displayed e-scooters' locations, but without the ability to actually rent an e-scooter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In the second part of the course, we had to create a &lt;i&gt;native app&lt;/i&gt;. We chose to use &lt;code&gt;React Native&lt;/code&gt; to be cross-platform and somehow close to what we had done during the first assignment. &lt;br&gt; Once again, I was in charge of taking care of the map utilities. However, I didn't find easy-to-use and cross-platform libraries for &lt;code&gt;React Native&lt;/code&gt; to display a map like &lt;code&gt;Leaflet&lt;/code&gt; does. Thus, I implemented the Map tiles workflow myself, using &lt;code&gt;Open Street Map&lt;/code&gt; data, in order to reproduce the behavior of a map component. It ended up working properly, except for zooming utilities. &lt;br&gt; We reached almost the same point with the native app as with the web app. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This experience allowed me to work as part of a team, fully in english as we were from different countries in Europe, and to develop my skills in web frontend and cross-platform development. I also gained experience in using &lt;code&gt;React&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;React Native&lt;/code&gt;, as well as in working with maps, using &lt;code&gt;Leaflet&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Open Street Map&lt;/code&gt; data. It also helped me to understand the challenges and differences in developing a web app and a native app.",

        "description": "I worked on a project for SIREHNA, a company that runs computational fluid dynamics (&lt;code&gt;CFD&lt;/code&gt;) simulations to evaluate ship performances (amongst other things). My role in this project was to create a simulation and data management environment that would help SIREHNA team track and retrieve their data, as well as automate low value-added tasks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; After working on understanding the users' needs, I worked with the team on defining the environment architecture. We chose to use a web server as the corner stone of the architecture. We highlighted the functional needs such as User authentication, User management and data storage, and then benchmarked technologies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I used &lt;code&gt;Girder&lt;/code&gt; library to instantiate a web server dedicated to managing users, their authentication and permissions. Using this library allowed us to gain time in implementing user authentication and management functionalities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; To answer the large data storage need - coming from geometries involved in the CFD simulations that can weight tens of GB - I set up a &lt;code&gt;MinIO&lt;/code&gt; instance. As &lt;code&gt;MinIO&lt;/code&gt; uses Amazon &lt;i&gt;Simple Storage Service&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;code&gt;S3&lt;/code&gt;) standards, I could easily connect it to the &lt;code&gt;Girder&lt;/code&gt;-based web server. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Another main part of the environment, which was very time consuming, was to automated some of the CFD simulation processes. As a &lt;code&gt;GitLab&lt;/code&gt; server was hosted internally, I used its pipelines features (which are mostly designed for &lt;code&gt;CI/CD&lt;/code&gt; purpose) to fully automate simulations. The idea was to use &lt;code&gt;GitLab&lt;/code&gt; pipeline's scheduler to separate the main steps of a simulation. The actual computation scripts were executed through &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt; scripts, while communications with the &lt;code&gt;Girder&lt;/code&gt;-based web server were done via &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt; scripts. In order to execute computations efficiently, we installed a &lt;code&gt;GitLab Runner&lt;/code&gt; on a device with a large computational power. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The final piece of the puzzle was creating a user-friendly web interface using &lt;code&gt;Girder&lt;/code&gt; web components, allowing users to easily start automated computations, monitor their progress, and keep track of their results.",

The goal of this project was to create a web app that allows users to stay in touch with their contacts regularly. The app is designed specifically for mobiles as the  main objective was to explore the potential of a web application to take advantage of various mobile device features, similarly to native mobile apps. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; First, the app uses &lt;code&gt;local storage&lt;/code&gt; feature of browsers, which enable user-specific storage on the client side. As the goal was to create a standalone website (i.e. without a back-end), this kind of storage was answering every need. I also though of using &lt;code&gt;IndexedDB&lt;/code&gt; API but as the data stored was small, I prefered to use &lt;code&gt;local storage&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Then, as the app goal was to make the user keep contacts with friends and familly, the app is able of openning the phone dialer app. This is done simply by using &lt;code&gt;tel:&lt;/code&gt; scheme. &lt;br&gt; In the future, I hope I'll be able of openning other external applications, such as &lt;i&gt;Facebook Messenger&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Finally, using &lt;code&gt;Navigator.contacts&lt;/code&gt; experimental API, the app is able (on &lt;i&gt;Chrome&lt;/i&gt;) of browsing the phone's contact list and let the user pick one to import in the app. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The app development is still in progress, and soon enough I would like to enable notifications, that would remember the user to contact the persons he/she haven't be talking for a while. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Technically, &lt;i&gt;TakeNews&lt;/i&gt; is hosted on &lt;code&gt;GitHub pages&lt;/code&gt; as a standalone web app. It is build with &lt;code&gt;React JS&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;MUI&lt;/code&gt; components and icons in addition to &lt;code&gt;Tailwind CSS&lt;/code&gt; for some styling. &lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;ESLint&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Prettier&lt;/code&gt; are used locally and in &lt;i&gt;Continuous Integration&lt;/i&gt; workflows to enforce code format. &lt;code&gt;Docker&lt;/code&gt; is used to offer a portable container, usable regardless of the &lt;i&gt;Operating System&lt;/i&gt;.",

I have condensed my experiences, projects and skills into a single &lt;code&gt;yaml&lt;/code&gt; file. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The second part of the project is the portfolio website. It is built using &lt;code&gt;Jekyll&lt;/code&gt;, and hosted on &lt;code&gt;GitHub pages&lt;/code&gt;. I used a pre-existing theme (named &lt;code&gt;Beautiful Jekyll&lt;/code&gt;) which I overrided with custom styles inspired from other &lt;code&gt;jekyll&lt;/code&gt; themes. Using a plugin, I managed to create almost entirely the website from the &lt;code&gt;yaml&lt;/code&gt; data file. I also implemented a search bar using &lt;code&gt;MiniSearch&lt;/code&gt; library. &lt;br&gt; In the end, I built a static website, hosted on &lt;code&gt;GitHub pages&lt;/code&gt;, with its own styling, search engine and domain name. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Finally, the third part of the project was a small &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; module dedicated to check the format of the data. I build a &lt;i&gt;grammar&lt;/i&gt; file in &lt;code&gt;yaml&lt;/code&gt;, representing the expected content of the data (e.g. that a project must a &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;, which is a text, and may have an &lt;code&gt;end-date&lt;/code&gt; with the format &lt;code&gt;dd-mm-yyyy&lt;/code&gt;) including the references workflow. Indeed, the whole idea was to have a consistent website, where projects may be linked to a job, and a job to a company, etc. &lt;br&gt; This &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; module was accompanied by formatters and linters, and used in a Continuous Integration workflow, to ensure that the data is well formatted all along its lifetime. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This project is still in progress when I wrote that.",

        "description": "During my internship in &lt;b&gt;LIRIS&lt;/b&gt; research laboratory, I was tasked to find computation methods to analyze a dataset prior to a machine learning training. I ended up with &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; modules capable of analysing and highlighting possible incorrect data or problematic values for a machine learning training. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; At the very beginning of my internship I learned theories about machine learning methods and technologies, applied to &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt;. I became familiar with machine learning concepts such as suppervised/unsupervised learning or underfiting/overfiting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Following a thesis, the idea of the project was to build scripts capable of finding incorrect data in a large dataset. The overall idea was the following: &lt;br&gt; Aiming a classification algorithm, the datasat has multiple &lt;i&gt;input attributes&lt;/i&gt; that are used to guess a &lt;i&gt;target attribute&lt;/i&gt;. Then, the goal was to evaluate the capability of guessing the &lt;i&gt;target attribute&lt;/i&gt; following the idea that, if there exist multiple instances in the dataset with the same &lt;i&gt;input attributes&lt;/i&gt; but a different &lt;i&gt;target&lt;/i&gt;, then any algorithm (regardless of its complexity) will be unable to be 100% sucessful. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Let's illustrate that with a common dataset in machine learning: &lt;i&gt;the Iris dataset&lt;/i&gt;. It is made of data about &lt;i&gt;Iris&lt;/i&gt; flowers and contains 5 attributes: the width and length of the sepals, the width and length of the petals and the species. Then, a classification algorithm has to guess the species based on the width and length of the sepals and petals. Applied on this dataset, the idea of the project was to check whether two flowers have the same length/width of the sepals and petals but being of two different species. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When considering the perfect equality as the comparison function between the &lt;i&gt;input attributes&lt;/i&gt;, the algorithm has a complexity of &lt;code&gt;O(n.log(n))&lt;/code&gt; (using a &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; as data structure). However, when considering a tolerance in the comparison function, the naive algorithm as a &lt;code&gt;O(n²)&lt;/code&gt; complexity, which is not acceptable for large datasets. Thus, my goal was to find ways to perform this search within an acceptable computation time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I did a literature search to solve the problem of comparing each element of the dataset to all the other elements in a reasonable computational time. &lt;br&gt; Following this, I implemented a method called &lt;i&gt;Blocking&lt;/i&gt;. The idea behind it is the following: &lt;ol&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mapping&lt;/b&gt; - First, the values are &lt;i&gt;mapped&lt;/i&gt; into &lt;i&gt;blocks&lt;/i&gt; of  similar values. The goal is to avoid comparisons between values that are obviously different.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reducing&lt;/b&gt; - The second step is to actually compare the values, using a naive  algorithm, block by block. This step can be parallelized, as each block is independent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt; I added a step to the process, to ensure to be exhaustive, taking advantage of the fact that we know the &lt;i&gt;tolerance&lt;/i&gt; in the comparison function. This step consists in duplicating the values at the &lt;i&gt;edges&lt;/i&gt; of the blocks inside the surrounding blocks, so that every value is compared to all of its neighbors, regardless of its absolute &lt;i&gt;position&lt;/i&gt; in the dataset. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The resulting algorithm returns pairs of contradictory values, i.e. values with similar input attributes while the target attributes are different. &lt;br&gt; This can be inputed into visualisations of &lt;i&gt;problematic&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;conclicting&lt;/i&gt; areas, i.e. areas of the dataset that contain a lot of contradictory values. This kind of visualisation can be useful for experts of the data source in order to explain why contradictory values appeared here or to question the manner of collecting data. &lt;br&gt; Finally, the contradictory pairs can be post-treated to search for the minimum set of values to remove from the dataset in order to have no contradictary pairs. This search is similar to the search for a minimum vertex cover, having as vertex the values and as edges the fact of being contradictory. Indeed, if a single value is contradictory to 10 others, the conclusion can easily be taken to remove this one, but with more complexe networks, the decision is harder to make. The search for the minimum vertex cover is proven to be &lt;i&gt;NP-hard&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In the end, the developed &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; scripts were able to identify in about 30 minutes the pairs of contradictory values on a dataset for which the naive algorithm would have taken about 1 year of calculation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This project allowed me to learn the concepts and problems related to machine learning, as well as to deepen my skills in algorithms and parallel computing. &lt;/p&gt;",

Using &lt;code&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/code&gt; library, I designed the data model, both for user authentication and authorization workflows and to store professional skills. Good practices of using linters/formaters (&lt;code&gt;black&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pylint&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;isort&lt;/code&gt; here), continuous integration (with &lt;code&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/code&gt;) and containerization (with &lt;code&gt;Docker&lt;/code&gt;) were used. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The front-end is based on &lt;code&gt;React JS&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MUI&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Tailwind CSS&lt;/code&gt; libraries (in opposition to &lt;code&gt;Vue JS&lt;/code&gt; that was used in the original template). It uses &lt;code&gt;Axios&lt;/code&gt; to communicate with the backend, including for authentication. Here again, good practices of using linters/formaters (&lt;code&gt;Prettier&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ESLint&lt;/code&gt;), continuous integration and containerization were applied. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I also set up a reverse proxy, based on &lt;code&gt;Traefik&lt;/code&gt;, in charge of redirecting API calls properly to the back-end. It uses &lt;code&gt;Let's Encrypt&lt;/code&gt; to automatically renew a &lt;code&gt;SSL&lt;/code&gt; certificate (needed to enable &lt;code&gt;HTTPS&lt;/code&gt; protocol). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The architecture is described using &lt;code&gt;Docker Compose&lt;/code&gt;, that includes the back-end, the front-end, the reverse proxy, and other services like the &lt;code&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/code&gt; database. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The back-end was hosted on &lt;i&gt;Amazon Web Service&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;code&gt;AWS&lt;/code&gt;), using an &lt;i&gt;Elastic Compute Cloud&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;code&gt;EC2&lt;/code&gt;) instance. A custom domain name (&lt;code&gt;mandin.dev&lt;/code&gt;) was dedicated to this website. Finally, Continuous Deployment workflows were setup to deploy automatically the website updates in production. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; During this project, which was ultimately abandoned, I learned how to build a real-world full-stack website, from the technical functionalities (e.g. authentication) to the deployment (&lt;code&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;AWS&lt;/code&gt;, domain name, &lt;code&gt;SSL&lt;/code&gt; certificates, etc.). I also learned how to set up a reverse proxy and how to work with various libraries and technologies like &lt;code&gt;FastAPI&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;React&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/code&gt;.",

This library allow to create interactive and visually appealing graphs within &lt;code&gt;Sphinx&lt;/code&gt; documentation, making it more informative and user-friendly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I learned how to create a &lt;code&gt;Sphinx&lt;/code&gt; extension and how to deploy a &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt; package to &lt;code&gt;PyPI&lt;/code&gt; (Python Package Index). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Personally, I use a lot &lt;code&gt;mermaid&lt;/code&gt; graphs, which are really easy to use and allow to create nice looking graphs with a ridiculously small boilerplate. Therefore, I wanted a &lt;code&gt;Sphinx&lt;/code&gt; extension with an open license (here MIT), that would allow the use of such graphs in generated documents. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This project is Open Source on &lt;code&gt;GitHub&lt;/code&gt; and I even had my very first contributor in this project, which submitted is own issue and pull request, that was finally merge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; During the development of this extension, a set of best practices was put in place. First, linters and formatters were used (&lt;code&gt;black&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pylint&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;isort&lt;/code&gt;), to ensure the format of the code. Secondly, continuous integration, via &lt;code&gt;GitHub actions&lt;/code&gt;, was implemented. It was in charge of making sure the format rules were respected.

The ground station could be any device with an internet browser (computer, tablet, phone). Indeed, the microcomputer on board the drone was running a &lt;code&gt;Node JS&lt;/code&gt;-based server, serving the interface of the ground station as a website and transmitting the video in peer to peer, using the &lt;code&gt;WebRTC&lt;/code&gt; technology. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; During this mission, I did several improvement of the ground station UI. &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;First, I added a 3D representation of the drone state, which displays the drone positionrelatively to its start position, computed via &lt;i&gt;SLAM&lt;/i&gt; algorithm (which was out of my mission scope). It also displayed the trajectory and the drone's actual angles (pitch, roll and yaw). This representation was done using the &lt;code&gt;Three.js&lt;/code&gt; library.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Secondly, I added control buttons to the UI, which improved the user's ability to control thedrone and made the interface more intuitive.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;ul&gt; This experience allowed me to work with new technologies and to understand how to improve the user experience.
